    <h1>Panem's Predatory Propaganda</h1>

    <p>This project seeks to analyze the various rhetorical strategies used by the Capitol of Panem (and other organizations like the rebel groups) over the course of the <em>Hunger Games</em> franchise, seen in all of the books, movies, and outside lore.</p> 

    <p>One of the key ways the Capitol maintains such a strong hold over each of the districts is via propaganda strategies used to reinforce the idea that they are indomitable and all-powerful, and anyone else is practically subhuman in comparison. This is seen in televised broadcasts, the Games themselves, and much more.</p>
