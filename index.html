      <h1>Panem's Predatory Propaganda</h1>

      <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-propaganda-posters-released-ahead-of-forthcoming-film-9554776.html" target="_blank">
        <img src="images/district-12.jpg.avif" width="100%" alt="official propaganda image">
      </a>

    <p>Above is an image used by the "official" website of Panem as part of a marketing strategy to promote the release of the film <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay: Part 1.</em> It depicts a young child eating an apple with a look of contentment on her face--which is smudged with coal. This is appropriate considering that District 12, which according to the poster the girl comes from, is designated as the official "coal mining" district of Panem.</p>

    <p>While child labor is strictly prohibited or restricted in the United States today, <em>The Hunger Games</em> depicts a post-apocalyptic future where child labor is not only allowed, but enforced, to meet stringent quotas from the Capitol. </p>

      <p>This project seeks to analyze the various rhetorical strategies used by the Capitol of Panem (and other organizations like the rebel groups) over the course of the <em>Hunger Games</em> franchise, seen in all of the books, movies, and outside lore.</p>

      <p>One of the key ways the Capitol maintains such a strong hold over each of the districts is via propaganda strategies used to reinforce the idea that they are indomitable and all-powerful, and anyone else is practically subhuman in comparison. This is seen in televised broadcasts, the Games themselves, and much more.</p>
