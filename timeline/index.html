    <h1>Timeline of propaganda in Panem</h1>

    This page serves as an analysis of how propaganda in Panem evolved over time and shaped the events of the series, beginning as a strategy that the Capitol used more and more to control the country and ending as a tool used by both President Snow and President Coin to advance both of their sides during the war. As we will see, both have devastating effects and raise the question of whether or not propaganda can ever be used for "good," at least in this franchise.
