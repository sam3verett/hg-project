    <h1>Timeline of Hunger Games propaganda</h1>

    This is an analysis of how propaganda in Panem evolved over time and shaped the events of the series, beginning with the Hunger Games used as a strategy by the Capitol to dominate the country and ending as a tool used by both President Snow and President Coin to advance both of their sides during the war. As we will see, both have devastating effects and raise the question of whether or not propaganda can ever be used for "good," at least in this franchise.

    <h2>Stage 1: The Games' Creation</h2>

        <p>Immediately following the Dark Days (before Snow's rise to power), the Capitol's use of propaganda was somewhat limited in comparison to how it is seen used later on. This directly mirrors the Games themselves, which aren't the same elaborate spectacle we see in the original novels and films; rather, the arena is crude, the cameras aren't as functional, and it takes place inside a constructed building rather than being integrated fully into the landscape.</p>

        <p>At this point in time, the gamemakers have not fully realized the potential of the Hunger Games and how they can serve as propaganda representing the Capitol's might and dominance ovee a crumbling landscape. Instead, it is little more than a punitive yearly ritual. As a result, viewership of the Games is dwindling.</p>

        Take the arena for instance:

         <a href="https://thehungergames.fandom.com/wiki/Capitol_Arena?file=Capitol_Arena_interior.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="../images/Capitol_Arena_interior.webp" width="100%" alt="10th Hunger Games Arena">
        </a>

      <p>The image of a dilapidated, almost empty ampitheater half-destroyed by a bombing doesn't exactly inspire confidence or awe. </p>

      <a href="https://www.panempropaganda.com/gallery/the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-official-stills/22182274" target="_blank">
        <img src="../images/lamina+and+treech+in+the+zoo+tbosas.jpg" width="100%" alt="tributes in the zoo">
        </a>
    
        <p>The tributes themselves are also not yet transformed into the "propaganda" we see later in the series; instead, in <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, they are caged in a zoo and are not made to put on an elaborate performance with costumes in front of a large crowd.</p>

        <p>Snow takes advantage of this weakness in his rise to power by proposing the Games be transformed into a much bigger spectable with audience members growing more attached to the contestants.</p>

    <h2>Stage 2: The Rise of Snow & Plutarch</h2>

<p>The above video does an excellent job of analyzing President Snow's role in transforming the tributes into Capitol propaganda, specifically focusing on Haymitch in <em>Sunrise on the Reaping.</em> He points out that the following two quotes at the beginning of the novel summarize the message that Suzanne Collins wants to send about propaganda as a whole:</p> 

<div class="callout">
<p>"All propaganda is lies, even when one is telling the truth. I don't think this matters so long as one knows what one is doing, and why." -George Orwell</p>
</div>

<div class="callout">
<p>"A truth that's told with bad intent beats all the lies you can't invent." -William Blake</p>
</div>

<p>The speaker argues that in this period of Panem's history, Snow used propaganda as a means of promoting the idea that the Capitol is strong, when in fact it was quite weak. This is similar to strategies used by Mussolini and other dictators.</p>

<a href="https://screenrant.com/hunger-games-sunrise-on-the-reaping-returning-characters-looks-comparison/" target="_blank">
        <img src="../images/ralph-fiennes-as-president-snow-in-hunger-games-sunrise-on-the-reaping.avif" width="100%" alt="middle-aged Snow">
        </a>

<p>On the flip side, we see the rise in power of Plutarch Heavensbee, a member of District 12's media team. He clearly understands the power of propaganda very well--perhaps even better than Snow--because he works behind the scenes so often, to his own advantage. He has this to say to the tributes in the novel:</p>

<div class="callout">
<p>“From the Capitol’s perspective, the Games are the best propaganda we have. You tributes, you’re our stars. You carry it out. But only if we control the narrative. Don’t let us.” (197)</p>
</div>

<p>Here, it's emphasized how Snow's strategy of controlling the tributes has transformed the Games into a key part of Panem's propaganda because of the way they are forced to "perform" a certain way at all times. He encourages Haymitch to break these rules in order to resist control.</p>

<a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1991510178051813732" target="_blank">
        <img src="../images/G6NDOR-XEAAts4u.jpeg" width="100%" alt="young Plutarch">
        </a>
<p>Unfortunately, in <em>Sunrise on the Reaping,</em> this strategy doesn't work; when people overtly refuse to conform for how President Snow wants them to act (like Lenore Dove refusying to cry on camera), he has them killed. However, Haymitch takes what he's learned and eventually uses it to help Katniss break free of this control.</p>

    <p>The second rebellion marks an era where the tables turn and propaganda becomes more than just a weapon of the Capitol; it is also the weapon of the rebels</p>
