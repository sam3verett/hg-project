    <h1>Timeline of propaganda in Panem</h1>

    This page serves as an analysis of how propaganda in Panem evolved over time and shaped the events of the series, beginning as a strategy that the Capitol used more and more to control the country and ending as a tool used by both President Snow and President Coin to advance both of their sides during the war. As we will see, both have devastating effects and raise the question of whether or not propaganda can ever be used for "good," at least in this franchise.

    <h2>Stage 1: The Games' Creation</h2>

        <p>Immediately following the Dark Days (before Snow's rise to power), the Capitol's use of propaganda was somewhat limited in comparison to how it is seen used later on. This directly mirrors the Games themselves, which aren't the same elaborate spectacle we see in the original novels and films; rather, the arena is crude, the cameras aren't as functional, and it takes place inside a constructed building rather than being integrated fully into the landscape.</p>

        <p>At this point in time, the gamemakers have not fully realized the potential of the Hunger Games and how they can serve as propaganda representing the Capitol's might and dominance ovee a crumbling landscape. Instead, it is little more than a punitive yearly ritual. As a result, viewership of the Games is dwindling.</p>

        Take the arena for instance:

         <a href="https://thehungergames.fandom.com/wiki/Capitol_Arena?file=Capitol_Arena_interior.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="../images/Capitol_Arena_interior.webp" width="100%" alt="10th Hunger Games Arena">
      </a>

      <p>The image of a dilapidated, almost empty ampitheater half-destroyed by a bombing doesn't exactly inspire confidence or awe. </p>

    <h2>Stage 4: Mockingjay & Rebel Propos</h2>

    <p>The second rebellion marks an era where the tables turn and propaganda becomes more than just a weapon of the Capitol; it is also the weapon of the rebels</p>
